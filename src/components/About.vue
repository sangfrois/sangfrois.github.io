    <h3>What I do, who I am</h3>

    <p>
    <b><i>I'm a proud psychonaut and a blunt charlatan. Je veux sortir des chemins battus.</i></b>
    <p>
    <b>||</b> My research consists in developing methods to capture underlying autonomic activity in subjective experiences (i.e. predominantly emotional states).

    <b>||</b> Scholarship holder of the <a href="https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/hacc/srch/pub/dsplyRprtngPrd?q.srchNm=Courtois&q.stts=0007&selectedCharityBn=850271289RR0001&dsrdPg=1">

    <h4>What I'm interested in</h4>
    <p>
    Any work that falls in the enactivist framework is appealing to me. My research interests encompass neuropsychology. Phenomenology, interviewing methods, computer science, biology, plants, psychedelics, mindfulness, art-therapy, music.
    </p>
    <p>

  As esoteric as it may sound, I like everything that has a cycle or vibrates; everything that I can measure or not.
    </p>
    <h4>My dream</h4>
    <p>
    An ecohub outside the city of Montreal where groups of individuals take part in activities that promote mental and physical health/well-being, and environment-friendly behavior (workshops for activists).
    </p>
    <p>
    Use discursive catharsis as well as skillful-intentionality to build social and individual goal-directed and organized behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
    Treat arts, digital arts and music as therapies, as well as drama/acting, and use non-judgemental awareness to promote creativity and compassion.
